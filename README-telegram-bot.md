# Telegram bot

The bot runs beside the recorder. It does not upload audio to Telegram. **Listen so far**, **Open audio**, and clip links open on your recorder's public URL.

## Setup

The API and the bot are two processes.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

In a second terminal, from `backend`:

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-token-from-BotFather
TELEGRAM_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-public-recorder-domain
BACKEND_PORT=3001
node telegram-bot.js
```

On Windows PowerShell, set the variables first:

```powershell
$env:TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "your-token-from-BotFather"
$env:TELEGRAM_PUBLIC_BASE_URL = "https://your-public-recorder-domain"
$env:BACKEND_PORT = "3001"
node telegram-bot.js
```

`TELEGRAM_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` must be the public `https://` address of this recorder. `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and private LAN addresses are rejected at startup because the phone cannot open them.

`TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` is required. Use the numeric Telegram user ID, not a @handle. The bot exits if it is missing. Set the BotFather token only in the terminal. Do not paste it into chat.

## Windows keep-alive

Put the token and numeric user ID in `backend/.env`. That file is gitignored.

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\windows\keep-alive.ps1
```

By default the script starts the recorder API, opens a temporary Cloudflare quick tunnel, and starts the bot with that public `https://` URL. If the API or the bot exits, they restart together. In quick mode a tunnel exit restarts them too. The current URL is written to `backend/data/public-url.txt`. `cloudflared` must be on PATH.

A quick tunnel hostname changes. The Vercel Mini App needs a stable hostname instead. After `cloudflared tunnel create`, set `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_NAME` and a stable `https://` `TELEGRAM_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in `backend/.env`. The script then runs that named tunnel and keeps the hostname. If cloudflared is already installed as a Windows service, set `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_EXTERNAL=1` so the script starts only the API and the bot.

The Mini App itself lives in `mini-app/` and is the piece that deploys to Vercel. It calls the recorder through `ORACLE_ORIGIN` with `RECORDER_RELAY_KEY`. Those values stay in the Vercel project and in `backend/.env`. Do not commit them.

This script is the process that keeps the bot running. A webhook connector cannot do that.

## Commands

Paste an X Space link, or send `/record <X Space link>`.

If the Space is not reachable yet, the bot offers **Watch for it**. That arms the recorder's existing monitor.

- `/status` lists active recordings, with **Listen so far** and **Stop & save**.
- `/archive` lists saved recordings, with **Open audio**, **Create clip**, and a confirmed **Delete**.
- `/clips` lists clips as direct playback links.
- After **Create clip**, send a range such as `1:30-4:00`.
